Word embedding in NLP is an important term that is used for representing words for text analysis in the form of real-valued vectors. 
It is an advancement in NLP that has improved the ability of computers to understand text-based content in a better way. 
It is considered one of the most significant breakthroughs of deep learning for solving challenging natural language processing problems.

In this approach, words and documents are represented in the form of numeric vectors allowing similar words to have similar vector representations. 
The extracted features are fed into a machine learning model so as to work with text data and preserve the semantic and syntactic information. 
This information once received in its converted form is used by NLP algorithms that easily digest these learned representations and process textual information.

Due to the perks this technology brings on the table, the popularity of ML NLP is surging making it one of the most chosen fields by the developers.
Now that you have a basic understanding of the topic, let us start from scratch by introducing you to word embeddings, its techniques, and applications.
